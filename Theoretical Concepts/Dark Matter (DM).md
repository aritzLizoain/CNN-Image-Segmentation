# Dark Matter (DM)

## Introduction

The problem of the DM in the universe, together with the explanation of dark energy, is still one of the major unsolved problems in cosmology, astrophysics and particle physics. Its identity links studies of the universe at both the largest and smallest observable scales. The DM problem, historically termed as the missing matter problem, was proposed by Fritz Zwicky in 1933, when his research on the Coma galaxy cluster inferred the existence of an anomaly. The virial theorem allows the calculation of galaxy masses making use of gravitational attraction. Zwicky calculated the theoretical galaxy cluster mass using the rotational velocity of luminous matter, and observed a discrepancy with the measured galaxy cluster mass. For the coming years various DM evidences were found, all of them based on gravitational interactions. However, given the universality of gravity, these evidences give very little information about the nature of DM.

The Planck mission's final data release (2018) showed that the dark energy density in the universe is Ω_λ ≈ 0.68, while matter density is Ω_m h^2 ≈ 0.32, from which around 85% is non-baryonic. None of the Standard Model particles is a good DM candidate; most of them are unstable, with lifetimes far shorter than the age of the universe, and the rest contribute to the baryonic energy density Ω_b, which is too small to be considered as a possibility. A vast majority of the scientific community believes that the evidence for DM requires particles beyond the Standard Model. Neutralinos, gravitinos, sterile neutrinos, axions and other particles related to hidden dark sectors, such as dark photons, are some of the researched candidates. Lately non-fundamental particles such as SIMPS (strongly interacting massive particles), and macroscopic objects such as primordial black holes, have also been proposed as DM candidates. Nonetheless, a minor part of the community does not believe in DM; they believe that the theory of gravitation is not complete, and work with alternative theories of gravity, such as Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND).

Three strategies are followed for DM detection: accelerators, direct and indirect detection:
