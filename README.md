# CNN Image Segmentation
## Application of deep learning techniques to images collected with Charge Coupled Devices to search for Dark Matter


The Standard Model of particle physics, while being able to make accurate predictions, has been proved to fail to explain various phenomena, such as astronomical dark matter observations.
In this work, a machine learning application has been implemented with the goal of studying dark matter candidates.
Images from Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) in different experiments DAMIC/DAMIC-M  located underground are used to test different deep learning algorithms.
A U-Net model is trained with Python's open-source library Keras. The model performs multi-class image segmentation in order to detect dark matter particle signals among background noise.

## 1. :computer: Getting Started

These instructions explain how to get a copy of the project to run it on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1.1 Installation

The project can be either cloned or downloaded to your own device.<br/>The source code of the application is implemented in Python, with the requirement of the following open-source libraries (version numbers are up to date: 21.06.2020):

* Keras (2.3.1)
* TensorFlow (2.1.0)
* Numpy (1.18.1)
* scikit-learn (0.22.1)
* scikit-image (0.9.3)
* OpenCV-Python (4.0.1)
* imgaug (0.4.0)
* Matplotlib (3.2.1)
* Pillow (7.1.2)

The libraries can manually be installed from the anaconda prompt with the command ``` pip install 'library_name' ```. Make sure the correct working environment is activated.
If a module cannot be properly installed (installing tensorflow might sometimes be troublesome), doing it through the anaconda navigator is a good option.

## 2. :snake: :page_facing_up: Python files

In  this  section  the  core  of  the  project  is  dissected.   Every  employed method is explained;  from the origination of an image,  to the training of the model, every necessary step in the creation of the deep learning application is analyzed.

### 2.1 image_details.py

:chart_with_upwards_trend: **Function**: sets details of the simulated images that are created in [image_simulation.py](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation#22-image_simulationpy). The pixel intensity value of each element in the image can be defined.

For more information regarding the image simulation please read [Theoretical Concepts: Image Simulation](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Theoretical%20Concepts/Image%20Simulation.md)

### 2.2 image_simulation.py

:chart_with_upwards_trend: **Function**: creates simulated images. Parameters such as number of images, elements, noise, glowing, etc. can be defined.
Images are saved to the saving path; arrays containing the predefined pixel intensity values are saved.<br/>
Testing and training images can be created. There is no need to create a validation dataset. The model automatically shuffles all images and creates a validation split in the training process.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Images/Example_Images/Simulated_CCD_Image.png" width="400"/>
</p>

*Simulated 256X256 pixel CCD image containing glowing, hot pixels and pixel clusters. The pixel intensity values are given in ADCs.*
:warning: **Caution**: it is important to be aware of the importance of the predefined pixel intensity values.
The way this model is implemented, image lables do not need to be provided. Image labels are directly obtained from the images.
In order to do this, image pixel intensity values are taken as reference to label different classes (please read [mask.py](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation#24-maskpy) for more information).
Therefore elements with overlapping pixel intensity values will not be correctly labeled.

:cop: **Requirements**: working directory path must contain [image_details.py](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/image_details.py) and [Cluster.pkl](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/Cluster.pkl).

For more information regarding the image simulation please read [Theoretical Concepts: Image Simulation](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Theoretical%20Concepts/Image%20Simulation.md)

### 2.3 load_dataset.py

* :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Function**: calculates the weights for the loss function and processes FITS files (DAMIC images). Originaly created to load the datasets as PNG files into arrays (unused in version 2.0).
  
  * [load_images](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/load_dataset.py#L27)(commented) is no longer used in version 2.0. It was used in version 1.0 for loading the PNG images.

  * [get_weights](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/load_dataset.py#L59)
    is used to avoid issues with imbalanced datasets, where images are too biased towards one class. 
    In a case where >95% of the pixels are labeled as background, and <1% as clusters, the model can give a 95% accuracy prediction, but all pixels might be predicted as background, giving a meaningless output.
    Please read [Theoretical Concepts: Network Implementation (Loss Function)](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Theoretical%20Concepts/Network%20Implementation.md#loss-function) for more information.
    The weight of each class is obtained as the inverse of its frequency in the training samples.
    The weights are then normalized to the number of classes.
    These weights are used by the model in the [weighted_categorical_crossentropy loss function](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/models.py#L31).

  * [process_fits](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/load_dataset.py#L73) is used to process the DAMIC images, which are given in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) file format.
    These files are read and saved as arrays that contain the collected charge by each CCD pixel. Since 256X256 pixel images are used for training the model, the DAMIC image is divided into sections of the same size, so they can be individually passed trhough the trained model, obtaining their respective predicted labels.
    The possibility to normalize, cut and resize the image is given.

  * [images_small2big](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/load_dataset.py#L183) is used to reconstruct the predictions of all sections into a full segmentation map.

  * [check_one_object](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/load_dataset.py#L201) is used to analyze the final output. It looks for a chosen category section by section. It returns a modified predicted label; it only shows background and the pixels classified as a chosen class.

### 2.4 mask.py

* :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Function**: creates the labels in an automated way, visualizes the output labels and can analyze and modify the images.

  * [mask_to_label](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L126) creates the segmentatin map that can be visualized. It applies a color multiplier to each class. Input shape = (number of images, height, width, 1) --> Output shape = (number of images, height, width, 3(RGB)).
  * [mask_to_label_one_object](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L167) creates the segmentatin map to visualize a chosen class. It is used by [check_one_object](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/load_dataset.py#L201). It applies a color multiplier to that one class. Input shape = (number of images, height, width, 1) --> Output shape = (number of images, height, width, 3(RGB)).
  * [statistics](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L208) shows the number of classes and their frequency on the dataset.
  * [get_percentages](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L222) simply returns the percentages of each class. This is used to calculate the weights for the loss function by [get_weights](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/0fc6f36abc9fcc63aee3c5129989fff54891147e/load_dataset.py#L52).
  * [visualize_label](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L236) is used to visualize the created label.
  * [create_masks](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L261) takes the images as input and returns the labels. These labels are used by the model to train and evaluate the model while training.
  * [create_labels](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L269) takes the images as input and returns the segmentation maps that can be visualized. 
  * [create_labels_noStat_noPrint](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L284) is the same as [create_labels](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/mask.py#L230) but it does not print the information in the console. Created in order to avoid the repeated information shown by the console.
  * [output_to_label](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L294) takes the model outputs and converts them into labels that can be visualized. 
  * [output_to_label_one_object](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L305) takes the model outputs and converts them into labels where a chosen class is visualized. 
  * [rgb2random](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L315) randomly changes the RGB colors of the images (unused).
  * [rgb2gray](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L336) converts the images to grayscale (unused).
  * [contrast](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L355) augments the contrast of the image (unused). 
  * [percentage_result](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/mask.py#L378) gives the percentage of each class in an output label.

* :warning: **Caution**: it is important to be aware of the importance of the predefined pixel intensity values in [image_details.py](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation#21-image_detailspy). The way this model is implemented, image lables do not need to be provided. Image labels are directly obtained from the images. In order to do this, image pixel intensity values are taken as reference to label different classes. Therefore elements with overlapping pixel intensity values will not be correctly labeled.<br/><br/>Labels can perfectly be created using a labeling software. However, for the purpose of this project, automatic pixel-wise labeling is a practical solution. Remember that, in case of using your own labels, image and label names must match.

### 2.5 augmentation.py

* :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Function**: applies data augmentation techniques to both images and corresponding labels. Please read the [imgaug documentation](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more information on augmentation techniques. This is an optional step; it is applied when only a few training samples are available, or when the desired property is not present in the dataset.

  * [augmentation_sequence_Color](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/augmentation.py#L20) and [augmentation_Color](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/augmentation.py#L29) apply color dropout, rotation, flipping.
  * [augmentation_sequence_Invert](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/augmentation.py#L77) and [augmentation_Invert](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Code/augmentation.py#L86) apply color channel inversion, dropout, logContrast, hue, gammaContrast.

## 4. :dart: Results NEEDS TO BE UPDATED

An imbalanced dataset entails further problems. A good solution to this issue has been creating balanced images, with approximately the same percentage of presence of each class. The classes have not been mixed in order to avoid confusion to the model when labeling the images.
Here is an example of an image used for training the model: ![alt text](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/master/Images/Example_Images/training_example.png "Training image example")

60 images have been used ([Train images](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/tree/master/Images/Train)). The model has been trained for 100 epochs with the following hyperparameters: 
* split = 0.2
* weights = [0.514, 0.840, 0.983, 1.663] <-- given by [get_weights](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Image-segmentation/blob/0fc6f36abc9fcc63aee3c5129989fff54891147e/load_dataset.py#L52)
* activation = 'elu' <br/>
  For more information regarding activation functions please read the [keras layer activation functions documentation](https://keras.io/api/layers/activations/).
* dropout = 0.18
* loss = weighted_categorical_crossentropy(weights)
* optimizer = 'adadelta' <br/>
  Adadelta optimization is a stochastic gradient descent method that is based on adaptive learning rate. There is no need to manually set any default learning rate. For more information regarding [adadelta](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/adadelta/) and other optimizers please read the [keras optimizers documentation](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/).<br/>

The rest of parameters have been left as default. Please note that these parameters work well for this particular dataset, but do not assure reliable results for all kind of datasets.
